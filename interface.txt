interface defines a type therefore a reference variable of an interface type created

Series S1

series is interface
bytwos is class which implements series


An interface can include variables, but they are not instance variables,
they are implicitly public, final, static and must be initialized. Thus, they are essentially constants.

One interface can inherit another using the keyword - extends

When a class implements an interface that inherits another interface, it must provide implementations for all
methods declared in the interface inheritance chanin (otherwise be abstract)

interface A 
{
    m1
}

interface B extends A 
{
    m2
}
class m1() implements B
{
    m1(){}
    m2(){}   both should be defined, if both are not defined then they should be defined as abstract
}
